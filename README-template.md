## My process

- So I started with creating the div which called container that contains all the project (the light blue background).
- Inside the container , i created the informations container div which represents the square in the middle holding the       paragraphs and the image
- I added 2 divs inside it , first one for the image and the second one for the informations below.
- i made the display flex so i can adjust them in the middle in a column direction .
- than i followed the widths and heights of the figma design for the pc version. 
- Same thing for the informations.
-In the end , i adjusted the width and height for the phone verson using media query. 
### Built with
